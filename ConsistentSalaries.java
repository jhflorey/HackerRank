At a large bank, each of N employees e besides the CEO (employee #1) reports to exactly one person ke (it is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting graph). Initially, each employee e has salary se.

The CEO performs Q operations. Each operation i designates an employee e and a dollar amount v, and e and anyone who reports to e (directly or indirectly) has v added to their salary. Determine after which operations there exists a worker who makes strictly more than someone she reports to (directly or indirectly).

Input: The first line contains two space-separated integers N,Q. The second line contains N−1 space-separated integers k2,k3,…,kN (employee 1 is the CEO and does not report to anyone). The third line contains N space-separated integers s1,s2,…,sN. Q lines follow, the i-th of which contains two space-separated integers ei,vi, representing the i-th operation.

Output: Q lines. The i-th line should be "GOOD" (without the quotes) if no worker has a strictly higher salary than someone she reports to and "BAD" otherwise.

Constraints: 1≤N,Q≤200000,1≤ke,ei≤N,1≤se≤107,−1000≤vi≤1000.

Scoring:

    Test cases worth 30 points will have 1≤N,Q≤300.
    Test cases worth an additional 20 points will have 1≤N,Q≤5000.

Sample Input:
4 4
1 1 3
40 30 20 10
4 20
4 -20
2 15
1 30

Sample Output:
BAD
GOOD
BAD
BAD

Explanation: After the first operation, employee #4 makes more than his supervisor employee #3. After the second operation, no employee makes more than any of his supervisors. After the third operation, employee #2 makes more than his supervisor employee #1. After the fourth operation, employee #2 makes more than his supervisor employee #1.
