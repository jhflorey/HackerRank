 A new problem of completing at most m transactions can be efficiently solved by using the method below.

 The profit of one transaction is price[i]-price[j] where i > j. We then can rewrite the expression to be: price[i]-price[i-1] + price[i-1]-price[i-2] + ... + price[j+1]-price[j]. If we construct an array of {diff[i]} = {price[i+1]-price[i]}, then the problem can be reduced to the maximum m segments sum problem on diff[], where m = 2 in this case. Then we can play the fancy dynamic programming to solve it.

 Here is one solution of the maximum m segments sum problem. The running time is O(NM).

 Let f[i][j] to be the maximum sum of j segments from the first i numbers, where the last element we choose is a[i]. We have two strategies to achieve it:

 Choosing the optimal j-1 segments from the first k numbers, and starting a new segment with a[i]:

 f[i][j] = f[k][j-1] + a[i], where j-1 <= k <= i-1.

 However, f[k][j-1] is the subproblems that we've already solved. If we memorize the optimal j-1 segments, namely g[j-1] = max(f[k][j-1]), the state transition can be achieved in O(1):

 f[i][j] = g[j-1] + a[i]

 Appending a[i] to the last segment in the first i-1 numbers

 f[i][j] = f[i-1][j] + a[i].

 Here is why we must choose a[i] in our strategies. If f[i-1][j] is not ends at a[i-1], then appending a[i] to f[i-1][j] will get j+1 segments, which violates the definition of f[i][j].

 int maxProfit(vector<int> &prices) {

 for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
 int diff = prices[i+1] - prices[i];
 int m = min(i+1, 2);
 for (int j = m; j >= 1; --j) {
 f[j] = max(f[j], g[j-1]) + diff;
 g[j] = max(g[j], f[j]);
 }
 }
 return max(g[1], g[2]);
