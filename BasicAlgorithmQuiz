This is a set of multiple choice questions, provided entirely for your self-assessment, and is based on the the most fundamental aspects of data structure and algorithms. The level of the questions is no more than that of what one would encounter in an introductory Data Structures class.

(b) O(n log n)
(c) O(n2)
(d) O(n3)
(e) O(log n)

Question 2.

Which of these is the worst case time complexity of Merge Sort - and cannot be expressed in lower order terms ?
(a) O(n)
(b) O(n log n)
(c) O(n2)
(d) O(n3)
(e) O(log n)

Question 3.

Which of these is the average case time complexity of Merge Sort - and cannot be expressed in lower order terms ?

(a) O(n)
(b) O(n log n)
(c) O(n2)

(e) O(log n)

Question 4.

Which of these is the time complexity involved in building a heap of n elements - and cannot be expressed in lower order terms ?

Question 6.

The Dijkstra algorithm for finding the shortest paths involves the traversal of nodes in an order similar to: (a) Breadth first search
(b) Depth first search
(c) Topological sort
(d) None of these

Question 7.

Which of the following statements is true? (The total number of push/pop/enque/deque calls made should not depend on the number of elements in the stack or queue)

A union find data-structure is commonly applied while implementing:
(a) A depth-first search traversal of a graph.
