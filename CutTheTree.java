Atul is into graph theory, and he is learning about trees nowadays. He observed that the removal of an edge from a given tree T will result in formation of two separate trees T1 and T2.

Each vertex of the tree T is assigned a positive integer. Your task is to remove an edge, such that, the Tree_diff of the resultant trees is minimized. Tree_diff is defined as

 F(T) = Sum of numbers written on each vertex of a Tree T
 Tree_diff(T) = abs(F(T1) - F(T2))
Input Format
The first line will contain an integer N, i.e., the number of vertices in the tree.
The next line will contain N integers separated by a single space, i.e., the values assigned to each of the vertices.
The next (N-1) lines contain pair of integers separated by a single space and denote the edges of the tree.
In the above input, the vertices are numbered from 1 to N.

Output Format
A single line containing the minimum value of Tree_diff.

Constraints
3 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ number written on each vertex ≤ 1001

Sample Input

6
100 200 100 500 100 600
1 2
2 3
2 5
4 5
5 6
Sample Output

400
Explanation

Cutting the edge at 1 2 would result in Tree_diff = 1400
Cutting the edge at 2 3 would result in Tree_diff = 1400
Cutting the edge at 2 5 would result in Tree_diff = 800
Cutting the edge at 4 5 would result in Tree_diff = 600
Cutting the edge at 5 6 would result in Tree_diff = 400

Hence, the answer is 400.
