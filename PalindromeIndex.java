You are given a string of lowercase letters. Your task is to figure out the index of the character on whose removal will make the string a palindrome. There will always be a valid solution.

Input Format
The first line contains T i.e. number of test cases.
T lines follow, each line containing a string.

Output Format
Print the position ( 0 index ) of the letter by removing which the string turns into a palindrome. For string, such as

bcbc
we can remove b at index 0 or c at index 3. Both the answers are accepted.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ length of string ≤ 100005
All characters are latin lower case indexed.

Sample Input #00

3
aaab
baa
aaa
Sample Output #00

3
0
0
Explanation

In the given input, T = 3,

For input aaab, we can see that removing b from the string makes the string a palindrome, hence the position 3.
For input baa, removing b from the string makes the string palindrome, hence the position 0.
As the string aaa is already a palindrome, you can output 0, 1 or 2 as removal of any of the characters still maintains the palindrome property.
